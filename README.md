# Wine Quality Data Analysis

This project provides complete **exploratory data analysis of red wine data**. The main purpose of the project is to uncover insights about the factor influencing the quality of red wine.

## Content
### Description of Dataset
The datasets are related to red variants of the Portuguese ***"Vinho Verde"*** wine.
The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).
Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available
(e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
